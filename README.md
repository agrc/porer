# Porter

A porter is person that 

- carries things, such as bags
- performs routine cleaning, likely on a train, taking care of the sleeping berths.

AGRC manages the additions, replacements, and deletions of SGID items in the broadest sense

## How to use

1. When an application, dataset, or both needs to be deleted or moved to a different long-term storage, [create a new issue](https://github.com/agrc/cemetery/issues/new/choose)
1. Choose the `Deprecate SGID Dataset or Web Application` template from the buttons
1. Tag the three triagers (one from each team) in the triage section:
   - [ ] Data Team Triage (@gregbunce)
1. The triagers will choose which items need to be handled and tag the appropriate people to handle them:
   - [ ] ArcGIS Online (@jacobdadams)
   - Items that don't need to be handled should be struck through (wrap the line with `~`'s) instead of being deleted:
      - `~ArcGISOnline (assigned to)~` (note there are no spaces between the `~`'s and the text to be struck out)
   - Once the triager has identified any steps required for their team or made any relevant comments, they should check the box to indicate that their triage is complete:
      - [x] Data Team Triage (@gregbunce)
1. The people assigned to different issues will check the boxes as they are completed and comment on the issue to notify the rest of the group:
   - [x] ArcGIS Online (@jacobdadams)
1. Once all boxes are checked, close the issue.
