Track deprecation tasks

## How to use

1. When an application, dataset, or both needs to be deleted or moved to a different long-term storage, [create a new issue](https://github.com/agrc/cemetery/issues/new/choose)
1. Choose the `removing_data_or_service` template from the buttons
1. Tag the three triagers (one from each team) in the triage section
1. The triagers will choose which items need to be handled and tag the appropriate people to handle them
   - Items that don't need to be handled should be struck through (wrap the line with `~`'s) instead of being deleted
1. The people assigned to different issues will check the boxes as they are completed
1. Once all boxes are checked, close the issue.
